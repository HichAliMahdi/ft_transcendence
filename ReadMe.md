#codebase here is the problem: the friend list pop up shows only on Multiplayer page it has to be on every page.
When I click on add a friend it propmpts me to add the Numeric ID of the person this is not acceptable first because the promp does not much the UI of the website and second I don't want a prompt when I click add firend on multiplayer page I want it to add the person I am playing against.
Third the friend list pop up can be displayed but cannot be hidden and there it is acceptable to add a friend with his USERNAME instead of ID and make the popup match the UI website
